# My `C` Playground
Well, I decided to start saving some of my `c` codes (that I write while practicing `c`) on Git as well, so this directory holds such codes.

While there might be some more efficient ways to solve the problems I solved here,
I consider tracking my growth very important, so the codes that I wrote in my early
days should not get lost, hence the purpose of this repository.

I have intentions to keep my source codes clear and easily readable, so that someone else can learn from them and play with them.
My works are arranged in different directories with names that serves as hints to contents of each directory.

**Indeed *`c` is fun***
