# C - Singly Linked List
In this directory are two `singly linked lists`;
one for integers and the other one for contacts.

While I'm yet to write a detailed README file, feel free to look around.
You may clone the repo, navigate into this directory and just enter the command `make` with no arguments.
Once you do so, 2 executable file named `int_list` and `myContact` will be automatically generated from the Makefile;
run them and see the result of the codes, reading from the main files â€” [`int_list-main.c`](./int_list-main.c) and [`contact-main.c`](./contact-main.c).
